## Test your React components

The goal of unit testing is to segregate each part of the program and test that the individual parts are working correctly. It isolates the smallest piece of testable software from the remainder of the code and determines whether it behaves exactly as you expect. We can find bugs in early stage.

In React to test component we use Jest and Enzyme. Jest was created by Facebook and is a testing framework to test javascript and React code. Together with Airbnbâ€™s Enzyme, which is a testing utility, makes it the perfect match to easily test your React application.
